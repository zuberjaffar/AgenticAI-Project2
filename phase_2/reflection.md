Major Strength: \n
Obviously, the power which Agentic AI unleashes to rapidly generate the bases of a future project within a very short time is quite remarkable.
It can quickly impersonate a whole project team within an organization, breaking down the problem at hand into stories, features, tasks with an initial risk assessment. As such, it can substantially reduce initial project costs.
Entirely up to the organization to then intenally review the proposed solution, breaking down the worker and evaluator results into solutions adapted to its internal policies.

Limitations: \n
The solution by definition proposes "non-deterministic" results. This could be raise concerns for organizations.
It is very sensitive to the quality of the defined "prompt" and "persona". Results can differ significantly depending on how these elements are initially defined. This may lead to changes in the project management office of the organization, requiring formalised discussions and agreements on the working of the prompts and persona to be used. While Agentic AI, AI generally speaking, brings solutions, it comes with its own challenges and complexities, organizations have yet to get accustomed to.

Suggested Improvement: \n
Not pertaining to the Email Router solution itself, bur rather the way the Phase 2 is presented to students, I felt that the expected output could've been better documented.
