The original prompt was: How can features of a product be defined?
The response to that prompt was: Features of a product can be defined by organizing similar user stories into cohesive groups. By grouping related user stories together, common themes and functionalities can be identified, leading to the definition of specific features that address the needs and requirements of the users. This process helps in creating a structured and organized list of features that form the basis of the product development.

 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
Identify the components and functionality required to configure email routing rules in the user interface. This may include options for setting up rules based on criteria such as sender, subject, or keywords, as well as actions to be taken when a rule is triggered (e.g., forwarding, archiving, marking as important). Design the layout and interactions of the user interface to allow users to easily create, edit, and manage these rules. Implement the necessary backend logic to process and apply the routing rules as defined by the user in the interface. Test the user interface to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the requirements specified in the user story.

 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
How can features of a product be defined?
Worker Agent Response:
Features of a product can be defined by organizing similar user stories into cohesive groups. By grouping related user stories together, common themes and functionalities can be identified, leading to the definition of specific features that address the needs and requirements of the users. This approach helps ensure that the features of the product are well-defined, cohesive, and aligned with the overall goals of the product.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the provided answer does not meet the criteria. The answer does not follow the specific structure required for defining product features, which includes Feature Name, Description, Key Functionality, and User Benefit. The answer provided discusses the process of defining features rather than presenting specific features in the required format.
